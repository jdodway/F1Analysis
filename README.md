# F1Anlysis

CSV files were downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020 , then uploaded into MySQL. Many characters contained accent marks, so due them being non-ascii, I edited the cells to contain only ascii characters.

I will be doing some analysis and visualizations, along with some data scraping in Python.

I will eventually create some visualizations in Tableau.
